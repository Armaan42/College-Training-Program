Data structures and algorithms are the building blocks of proagramming complex solution. Using DSA,  we can solve the complex solution.

It tells you to choose algorithms based on the program's needs.
C++ helps you in several factors such as memory management and time complexity instructions in an efficient manner and DSA with 
C++ is a plus point.
